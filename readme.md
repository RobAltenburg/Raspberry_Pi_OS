# Raspberry Pi OS #

I'm working through the Cambridge tutorial on writing an OS for the Raspberry Pi.

There are a few places I've had to edit Alex Chadwick's code to get it to work on my pi. It appears that changes in firmware and the toolchain break his published code.

This repository will hold my current working version along with some extras.
